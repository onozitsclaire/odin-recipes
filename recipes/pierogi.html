                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                        <li>7 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                        <li>1 large egg</li>
                        <li>1/2 pound potatoes</li>
                        <li>Pepper</li>
                        <li>3 medium yellow onions, finely chopped</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup quark cheese, cottage cheese or sour cream (4 oz)</li>
                        <p>
                            <h2>Preparation</h2>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h1>Step 1</h1>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prepare the dough: Add the flour and salt to a large bowl; whisk to combine. In a small saucepan, heat 1/2 cup water and the butter over medium-high until butter is melted, about 3 minutes. Pour the buttery liquid into the flour gradually, stirring it in as you add it. (The dough will be quite crumbly and flaky at this point, like a biscuit dough.) Stir in the egg until combined then move the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, 5 to 7 minutes. Cover the dough with a dampened towel or plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.

                            <h1>Step 2</h1>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prepare the filling: Peel the potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Add them to a large pot, sprinkle with 1 tablespoon salt and cover with cold water by about 2 inches. Bring to a boil over high and continue to cook at a simmer until potatoes are tender, about 25 minutes.

                            <h1>Step 3</h1>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the potatoes cook, prepare the onions: In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high. Add the onions, season generously with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden-brown and softened, about 12 minutes. Set aside about 1 cup of onions for garnish and add the rest to a medium bowl.
